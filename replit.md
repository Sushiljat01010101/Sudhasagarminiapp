- **DOM Element Caching**: Performance optimization through cached DOM element references
- **Form Validation**: Client-side validation with configurable rules for names, mobile numbers, and quantities

### User Interface Design
- **Modal-based Interactions**: Primary user actions handled through overlay modals
- **Toast Notifications**: Non-intrusive feedback system for user actions
- **Loading States**: Visual feedback during API requests and form submissions
- **Accessibility Features**: ARIA labels, semantic HTML, and keyboard navigation support

### API Integration Pattern
